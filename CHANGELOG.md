## v1.0.3 - 2017-02-11

### Bug fixes

Fixed a bug where an album by multiple artists would not be downloadable in bulk. This was because all albums were assumed to by one artist only. This means that there were actually a different album (with the same name) for every atist. Which in turn means that by downloading such an album, you would get only the songs for the particular artist.

## v1.0.2 - 2016-10-12

### Bug fixes

* Fixed a bug where track attributes were jumbled while scanning a library. The effect of this bug were tracks with wrong data for album, track number, title or artist.
